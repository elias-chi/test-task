## Multiple Payment Processing Providers Handler

To handle multiple payment processing providers in a flexible and maintainable way, we can use the Factory Method design pattern. This pattern allows us to define an interface for creating objects but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In our case, each payment provider (Stripe, Braintree, PayPal) will have its own factory, and the main order processing code will interact with these factories through a common interface.

### Implementation Overview:

- We define the `PaymentProvider` interface, which all payment provider classes (`StripeProvider`, `BraintreeProvider`, `PayPalProvider`) implement.
- Each payment provider has its own factory (`StripeFactory`, `BraintreeFactory`, `PayPalFactory`) that implements the `PaymentProviderFactory` interface.
- The `OrderProcessor` class takes a `PaymentProviderFactory` as a dependency and uses it to create the appropriate payment provider instance based on the customer's choice during checkout.
- The main order processing code (`processOrder` method) remains unchanged regardless of the chosen payment provider. We can easily add or remove payment options by creating new provider classes and factories without modifying the `OrderProcessor` class.
